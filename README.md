# 📈 Sales Prediction using Python

A machine learning project to predict sales using historical data. This project applies regression techniques to forecast future sales based on TV advertising spend.

In this example, the model predicts sales based on a dataset of TV advertising spend vs. sales figures using **Linear Regression**.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preparation and preprocessing
- Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising spend
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction for future sales based on input advertising budget
- Visualization of actual vs predicted sales

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7**
- **pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn** – for implementing Linear Regression model
- **matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional, for development)

## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

You will need to install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


## 📥 Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/NagisettiSurya/Sales-Prediction

cd Sales-Prediction

## 🏃‍♂️ Run the Application

Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, run the script to see the sales prediction in action:

python sales_prediction.py
